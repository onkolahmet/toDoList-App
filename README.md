- Complete version of ToDoList App using node.js, express.js &amp; mongoDB

## How It Works ?
- User can add custom lists with different names and all the lists will appear on the left side. If user wants to create a list with an existing name, error related to this    problem will appear on the screen.
- User may change the contents of the items from the lists and also can edit the name of the list simultaneously both for the toDoList and Completed Tasks.
- If the task is done and user clicks to the check box, it will appear on the "Completed Tasks". 
- Furtherly, user may get that completed task back to the toDoList by clicking the check box again. 
- With that way, that task will return to the toDoList which it belongs to. 
- Other than completing the tasks, user can delete the task either from the list itself or from Completed Tasks.
